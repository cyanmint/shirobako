# GitHub Copilot Custom Instructions

### Header Requirement

- **Mandatory Header**: Any file generated or created by the GitHub Copilot coding agent must include the following header at the top to inform users about the nature of AI-generated content:

  - For files using `<!-- -->` (e.g., HTML, XML):
    ```
    <!--
      This file contains content generated by AI.
      AI-generated contents are not applicable for copyright nor warranty.
    -->
    ```

  - For files using `/** */` (e.g., JavaScript, C++):
    ```
    /**
    * This file contains content generated by AI.
    * AI-generated contents are not applicable for copyright nor warranty.
    */
    ```

  - For files using `#` (e.g., Python, Shell):
    ```
      # This file contains content generated by AI.
      # AI-generated contents are not applicable for copyright nor warranty.
    ```
  - Please adapt for different languages.

### Build and Test Requirement
